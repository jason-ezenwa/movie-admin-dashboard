## Tech Stack
React: The project is built using the React JavaScript library, providing a robust and efficient front-end framework.

Material-UI: I've utilized Material-UI, a popular React UI framework, to create a sleek and responsive user interface.

JSX: I used JSX (JavaScript XML) for defining component structures, making it easier to work with React's component-based architecture.

CSS: This project incorporates Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for styling and layout, ensuring a polished and visually appealing user interface.
